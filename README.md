# Movie Watchlist.

## Description
Movie Watchlist is a single-page application (SPA) built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to browse a list of movies, add selected titles to a personal watchlist, and filter movies in real time using a search bar.

The project utilizes json-server to serve local API data and demonstrates strong use of DOM manipulation, asynchronous JavaScript (fetch), event delegation, and array methods for dynamic rendering and user interaction.

## Features
- Add movies to a personal watchlist.
- Remove movies from the watchlist.
- Filter/search movies by title in real time.
- Dynamic DOM rendering with no page reloads.
- Prevent duplicate entries in the watchlist.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript (ES6)
- JSON Server
- Git & GitHub

## Installation & Usage
- Clone this repository.
- Run json-server --watch db.json in the terminal to start the local server.
